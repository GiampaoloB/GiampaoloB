- 😄 Pronouns: He, him
- ⚡ Fun fact: huge fan of pop culture, feel free to take a look at my pop-culture podcast (yes it's in french) - http://sijepeuxmepermettre.com/.
- ⚡ Other fun facts: Probably lost in one of my favorite anime like "Fullmetal Alchemist" or "Samurai Champloo". I'm also a huge sci-fi book nerd—think "The Three-Body Problem" and "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Oh, and I play a ton of video games too. Just managed to beat "Mega Man 1" recently - what a throwback, right? Love how all these hobbies keep my creativity buzzing and problem-solving sharp!
